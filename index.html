      An incredibly lovable character- like other cartoon 
      characters Bugs Bunny, Mickey Mouse and Scooby-Doo, 
      SpongeBob was a very likable character to all ages. 
      Not just kids, but teens and adults as well. 
      He's well-liked because of his optimism, kindness and 
      how he always wins.

      SpongeBob Is an Optimist
      He has a dead-end job working for a greedy and inconsiderate 
      boss and he has an annoying neighbor and co-worker who 
      despises him, yet he is one of the most optimistic
      characters in pop-culture. SpongeBob adores his job,
      thinks the world of his boss and co-worker, and never 
      stops smiling.

      Why SpongeBob is the best cartoon ever made?
      On May 1, 1999 a legendary cartoon would be aired, 
      and that cartoon would be known as SpongeBob SquarePants.
      Stephen Hillenburg the creator of this legendary show had 
      made history. ... It came to him that the series should take
      place underwater, with a focus on those creatures.
